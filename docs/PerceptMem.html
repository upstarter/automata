        <section id="moduledoc">
<p>When a DataRecord enters the Perception System, a new PerceptMemory is
created, and as the DataRecord is pushed through the Percept Tree, each
percept that registers a positive match adds its rExUnittive data to the new
PerceptMemory.</p>
<p>PerceptMemory can be thought of as Beliefs about the world ( individually and
in aggregagte(histories of memories) ) Percepts are organized hierarchically
in terms of their specificity. For example, a ShapePercept will activate on
the presence of any kind of shape whereas one of its children may activate
only on a specific type of shape (e.g. a CircleShapePercept). The children
of a percept will receive only the data that was extracted by its parent to
process. This hierarchical structure is primarily an efficiency mechanism
(no point in testing whether an event is the spoken word “sit” if it has
already been determined that the event was not an acoustic one) and is very
similar to previous hierarchy-of-sensors approaches. Many percepts are
plastic, using statistical models to characterize and refine their response
properties.</p>
<p>Percepts can modulate their “receptive fields” (the space of inputs to which
they will respond positively), and, in concert with the Action System, can
modify the topology of the tree itself, dynamically growing a hierarchy of
children in a process called innovation.</p>
<p>The process of innovation is reward-driven, with only percepts that are
believed to be correlated with increasing the reliability of an action in
producing a desirable outcome being prompted to innovate. Both the
confidence and the extracted data of every percept are cached in a
PerceptMemory object.</p>
<p>Both the confidence and the extracted data of every percept are cached in a
PerceptMemory object. When a DataRecord enters the Perception System, a new
PerceptMemory is created, and as the DataRecord is pushed through the
Percept Tree, each percept that registers a positive match adds its
rExUnittive data to the new PerceptMemory. Thus, given a sensory stimulus,
the PerceptMemory represents all the agent can know about that stimulus.</p>
<p>Thus, given a sensory stimulus, the PerceptMemory represents all the agent
can know about that stimulus.</p>
<p>Working Memory</p>
<p>Like other agent-control architectures, we use a Working Memory structure
whose function mirrors that of the pyschological conception of Working Memory –
an object-based memory that contains information about the immediate task or
context. The ultimate goal of Working Memory is to provide a sensory history
of objects in the world.</p>
<p>It is on the basis of these histories that action-decisions will be made,
internal credit for reward assigned, motor-movements modulated, etc. Working
Memory is a repository for persistent PerceptMemory objects. Taken together,
they constitute the agent&#39;s “view” of the world.</p>
<p>The PerceptMemory is itself a useful structure. By caching
together the various perceptual impressions made by a world event (“the
thing that was in front of me was also blue,” blueness and relative location
being separate Percepts) they solve (or perhaps avoid) the infamous
perceptual binding problem ([Treisman 1998]). They also allow us to submit
complex queries to WorkingMemory: “which is the bird that is nearest me?”</p>
<p>PerceptMemory objects become even more useful when they incorporate a time
dimension with the data they contain. On any one timestep, the PerceptMemory
objects that come out of the Perception System will by necessity only
contain information gathered in that timestep. However, as events often
extend through time, it is possible to match PerceptMemory objects from
previous timesteps. Thus a recent visual event may represent only the latest
sighting of an object that we have been tracking for some time.</p>
<p>A DataRecord representing the utterance comes in from the world, causing
certain Percepts in the Percept Tree to activate. The Perception System caches
the confidences and data corresponding to these Percepts in a PerceptMemory
object. This object then matches itself with the most similar existing
PerceptMemory in Working Memory, and adds its data onto the history of data
that it maintains.</p>
<p>The Working Memory structure is meant to mirror this psychological conception
of Working Memory. The Working Memory maintains a list of persistent
PerceptMemory objects that together constitute the agent’s “view” of the
current context. That “view,” however, is informed by more than just direct
perception. Instead, it is a patchwork of perceptions, predictions and
hypotheses. Any component of Automata that has something to say about how the
world is (or might be) can modify PerceptMemory objects or post new ones. It
is on the basis of these objects, whether directly perceived or not, that
action-decisions will be made, internal credit for reward will be assigned,
motor-movements will be modulated, and so on.</p>
<p>When a new DataRecord is pushed through the Percept Tree, each Percept that
registers a positive match caches its confidence and data in a table in the
PerceptMemory. This PerceptMemory is then passed off to Working Memory. It
is then “matched” against existing PerceptMemory objects stored there to
determine if it is truly novel, or rather a continuation of an existing
PerceptMemory (for example, is it the same red ball as the red ball that we
saw an instant ago in the same place).</p>
<p>In the case of visual events, matching is done on the basis of shape, or on
the basis of location when shape is not enough to disambiguate incoming visual
events (as is often the case with two nearby bird). This matching mechanism
also allows events of differing modalities to be combined. If there is good
indication that an acoustic event and a visual one belong together (for
example, they originate in more or less the same region of space) then they
may be matched together in Working Memory, presenting both sight and sound
information through a single PerceptMemory and thus giving the impression
that, for example, it was the shepherd who said, “sit.” In either case, if a
match is found, the data from the new PerceptMemory is added to the history
being kept in the old one. The new confidence is also added to a history of
confidences. On timesteps in which new information for a given Percept is not
observed, its confidence level is decayed. The rate of decay is determined in
part by the Percept itself (confidence in another agent’s location might decay
rapidly without observation, but confidence in its shape probably would not.)</p>
