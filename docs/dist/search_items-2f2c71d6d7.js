In an ideal world, each AI would have an entire tree allocated to it, with each behavior having a persistent amount of storage allocated to it, so that any state necessary for its functioning would simply always be available. However, assuming about 100 actors allocated at a time about 60 behaviors in the average tree, and each behavior taking up about 32 bytes of memory, this gives us about 192K of persistent behavior storage. Clearly, as the tree grows even further this becomes even more of a memory burden, ExUnitially for a platform like the Xbox. We can cut down on this burden considerably if we note that in the vast majority of cases, we are only really interested in a small number of behaviors - those that are actually running (the current leaf, its parent, it grandparent and so on up the tree). The obvious optimization to make is to create a small pool of state memory for each actor divided into chunks corresponding to levels of the hierarchy. The tree becomes a free-standing static structure (i.e. is not allocated per actor) and the behaviors themselves become code fragments that operate on a chunk. (The same sort of memory usage can be obtained in an object oriented way if parent behavior objects only instantiate their children at the time that the children are selected. This was the approach taken in [Alt04]). Our memory usage suddenly becomes far more efficient: 100 actors times 64 bytes (an upper bound on the amount behavior storage needed) times 4 layers (in the case of Halo 2), or about 25K. Very importantly, this number only grows with the maximum depth of the tree, not the number of behaviors. This leaves us with another problem however, the problem of persistent behavior state. There are numerous instances in the Halo 2 repertoire where behaviors are disallowed for a certain amount of time after their last successful performance (grenade-throwing, for example). In the ideal world, this information about &quot;last execution time&quot; would be stored in the persistently allocated grenade behavior. However, as that storage in the above scheme is only temporarily allocated, we need somewhere else to store the persistent behavior data. There is an even worse example - what about per-target persistent behavior state? Consider the search behavior. Search would like to indicate when it fails in its operation on a particular target. This lets the actor know to forget about that target and concentrate its efforts elsewhere. However, this doesn&#39;t preclude the actor going and searching for a different target - so the behavior cannot simply be turned off once it has failed. Memory - in the psychological sense of stored information on past actions and events, not in the sense of RAM - presents a problem that is inherent to the tree structure. The solution in any world besides the ideal one is to create a memory pool - or a number of memory pools - outside the tree to act as its storage proxy. When we consider our memory needs more generally, we can quickly distinguish at least four different categories: Per-behavior (persistent): grenade throws, recent vehicle actions Per-behavior (short-term): state lost when the behavior finishes Per-object: perception information, last seen position, last seen orientation Per-object per-behavior: last-meleed time, search failures, pathfinding-to failures","ref":"Automata.Blackboard.html","title":"Automata.Blackboard","type":"module"},{"doc":"Classification hierarchy (Perception System) Once the stimulus from the world has been “sensed,” it can then be “perceived.” The distinction between sensing and perceiving is important.

First, what is the fundamental representation of action used by the system? Second, how does the system choose which actions to perform at a given instant? Many types of decision-making processes are possible here. Third, how can the choice of action be modified to allow the agent to learn from experience? ActionGroup = {} ActionTuple = {} fields: trigger - A piece of code that returns a scalar value representing the relevance of an ActionTuple given the current state of Working Memory. Triggers are typically references to percepts in the Percept Tree (a trigger that points to the &quot;Bird Shape” percept will return a high relevance given any PerceptMemory that has a high &quot;Bird Shape” confidence). However, the TriggerContext is general enough that more complex trigger-conditions can be hand-crafted. As we will see, Percept-based triggers are useful because they can be automatically generated through the learning process action - Primitive action to take (usually modify blackboard as event system) object - Target for the Action often defined in terms of percepts When an ActionTuple is active, the ObjectContext posts the PerceptMemory chosen into the OBJECT_OF_ATTENTION posting of the internal blackboard, thereby making it available to the rest of the system.

PerceptMemory can be thought of as Beliefs about the world ( individually and in aggregagte(histories of memories) ) Percepts are organized hierarchically in terms of their specificity. For example, a ShapePercept will activate on the presence of any kind of shape whereas one of its children may activate only on a specific type of shape (e.g. a CircleShapePercept). The children of a percept will receive only the data that was extracted by its parent to process. This hierarchical structure is primarily an efficiency mechanism (no point in testing whether an event is the spoken word “sit” if it has already been determined that the event was not an acoustic one) and is very similar to previous hierarchy-of-sensors approaches. Many percepts are plastic, using statistical models to characterize and refine their response properties. Percepts can modulate their “receptive fields” (the space of inputs to which they will respond positively), and, in concert with the Action System, can modify the topology of the tree itself, dynamically growing a hierarchy of children in a process called innovation. The process of innovation is reward-driven, with only percepts that are believed to be correlated with increasing the reliability of an action in producing a desirable outcome being prompted to innovate. Both the confidence and the extracted data of every percept are cached in a PerceptMemory object. Both the confidence and the extracted data of every percept are cached in a PerceptMemory object. When a DataRecord enters the Perception System, a new PerceptMemory is created, and as the DataRecord is pushed through the Percept Tree, each percept that registers a positive match adds its rExUnittive data to the new PerceptMemory. Thus, given a sensory stimulus, the PerceptMemory represents all the agent can know about that stimulus. Thus, given a sensory stimulus, the PerceptMemory represents all the agent can know about that stimulus. Working Memory Like other agent-control architectures, we use a Working Memory structure whose function mirrors that of the pyschological conception of Working Memory – an object-based memory that contains information about the immediate task or context. The ultimate goal of Working Memory is to provide a sensory history of objects in the world. It is on the basis of these histories that action-decisions will be made, internal credit for reward assigned, motor-movements modulated, etc. Working Memory is a repository for persistent PerceptMemory objects. Taken together, they constitute the agent&#39;s “view” of the world. The PerceptMemory is itself a useful structure. By caching together the various perceptual impressions made by a world event (“the thing that was in front of me was also blue,” blueness and relative location being separate Percepts) they solve (or perhaps avoid) the infamous perceptual binding problem ([Treisman 1998]). They also allow us to submit complex queries to WorkingMemory: “which is the bird that is nearest me?” PerceptMemory objects become even more useful when they incorporate a time dimension with the data they contain. On any one timestep, the PerceptMemory objects that come out of the Perception System will by necessity only contain information gathered in that timestep. However, as events often extend through time, it is possible to match PerceptMemory objects from previous timesteps. Thus a recent visual event may represent only the latest sighting of an object that we have been tracking for some time. A DataRecord representing the utterance comes in from the world, causing certain Percepts in the Percept Tree to activate. The Perception System caches the confidences and data corresponding to these Percepts in a PerceptMemory object. This object then matches itself with the most similar existing PerceptMemory in Working Memory, and adds its data onto the history of data that it maintains. The Working Memory structure is meant to mirror this psychological conception of Working Memory. The Working Memory maintains a list of persistent PerceptMemory objects that together constitute the agent’s “view” of the current context. That “view,” however, is informed by more than just direct perception. Instead, it is a patchwork of perceptions, predictions and hypotheses. Any component of Automata that has something to say about how the world is (or might be) can modify PerceptMemory objects or post new ones. It is on the basis of these objects, whether directly perceived or not, that action-decisions will be made, internal credit for reward will be assigned, motor-movements will be modulated, and so on. When a new DataRecord is pushed through the Percept Tree, each Percept that registers a positive match caches its confidence and data in a table in the PerceptMemory. This PerceptMemory is then passed off to Working Memory. It is then “matched” against existing PerceptMemory objects stored there to determine if it is truly novel, or rather a continuation of an existing PerceptMemory (for example, is it the same red ball as the red ball that we saw an instant ago in the same place). In the case of visual events, matching is done on the basis of shape, or on the basis of location when shape is not enough to disambiguate incoming visual events (as is often the case with two nearby bird). This matching mechanism also allows events of differing modalities to be combined. If there is good indication that an acoustic event and a visual one belong together (for example, they originate in more or less the same region of space) then they may be matched together in Working Memory, presenting both sight and sound information through a single PerceptMemory and thus giving the impression that, for example, it was the shepherd who said, “sit.” In either case, if a match is found, the data from the new PerceptMemory is added to the history being kept in the old one. The new confidence is also added to a history of confidences. On timesteps in which new information for a given Percept is not observed, its confidence level is decayed. The rate of decay is determined in part by the Percept itself (confidence in another agent’s location might decay rapidly without observation, but confidence in its shape probably would not.)","ref":"PerceptMem.html","title":"PerceptMem","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"","ref":"PerceptMem.html#c:match/1","title":"PerceptMem.match/1","type":"callback"},{"doc":"A Tree of Percepts The Perception System takes the form of a Percept Tree. A Percept is an atomic classification and data extraction unit that models some aspect of the sensory inputs passed in by the Sensory System. Given a DataRecord it returns both a match probability (the BirdPercept will return the probability that a DataRecord represents the experience of seeing a bird) and, if the match is above a threshold, a piece of extracted data (such as body-space coordinates of the bird). The details of how the confidence is computed and what exact data is extracted are left to the individual percept. The percept structure might encapsulate a neural net or it might encapsulate a simple “if … then …else” clause. This freedom of form is one of the keys to making the Perception System extensible, since the system makes no assumptions about what a percept will detect, what type of data it will extract or how it will be implemented.","ref":"PerceptTree.html","title":"PerceptTree","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"","ref":"PerceptTree.html#c:add_child/1","title":"PerceptTree.add_child/1","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"PerceptTree.html#c:clear_children/0","title":"PerceptTree.clear_children/0","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"PerceptTree.html#c:continue_status/0","title":"PerceptTree.continue_status/0","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"PerceptTree.html#c:remove_child/1","title":"PerceptTree.remove_child/1","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"Sensor.html","title":"Sensor","type":"module"},{"doc":"","ref":"Seq1.html","title":"Seq1","type":"module"},{"doc":"Callback implementation for Automaton.Types.BT.Behavior.abort/0.","ref":"Seq1.html#abort/0","title":"Seq1.abort/0","type":"function"},{"doc":"Callback implementation for Automaton.Types.BT.Behavior.aborted?/0.","ref":"Seq1.html#aborted?/0","title":"Seq1.aborted?/0","type":"function"},{"doc":"Returns a specification to start this module under a supervisor.

Elixir for world class control fault tolerance and distribution, while leveraging inter-operability to compensate for lack of high dimensional function approximation (linear solver) performance without NIF&#39;s: erlport (python) julia + python rust + python The Automata framework has three abstract semantic layers: Environment (State Space Representations) These are the maps of the territory. Without a good map, any adventurer could easily get lost. To fit the information available to the problem at hand, we separate the data structures representing our models into distinct layers with well defined boundaries. Reasoning (Decision Making, Action Selection) All agents have some formulation of action selection, otherwise they would never achieve their goals. To keep agent decision making as decoupled as possible, we introduce a layer which fits the mode of reasoning to the state space. Knowledge (Memory, Local &amp; Global Histories) Interchangeable memory modules across short term working memory, blackboards, and knowledge bases. Read the wiki and/or the docs for more about the technologies underlying Automata. Requirements Autonomy is the capacity of agent(s) to achieve a set of coordinated goals by their own means (without human intervention) adapting to environment variations. It combines five complementary aspects: Perception e.g. interpretation of stimuli, removing ambiguity/vagueness from complex input data and determining relevant information based on context/strata/motif specific communications Reflection e.g. building/updating a faithful environment run-time model Goal management e.g. choosing among possible goals the most appropriate ones for a given configuration of the environment model Planning to achieve chosen goals Self-adaptation e.g. the ability to adjust behavior through learning and reasoning and to change dynamically the goal management and planning processes. Note that the five aspects are orthogonal. The first two aspects deal with “understanding” the map of the environment. The third and the forth aspects deal with autonomy of decision. Self adaptation ensures adequacy of decisions with rExUnitt to the environment map. See MMLC2. A system is defined as an Autonomous Decentralized System (ADS) if the following two properties are satisfied: Autonomous Controllability: Even if any subsystem fails, is repaired, and/or is newly added, the other subsystems can continue to manage themselves and function.

Design Standards Abstraction &amp; Modularity are key. Spend the time and/or Ask on the Slack Channel to find the right abstraction. In terms of modularity, If its more than 10-20 lines, put it in a unit Function, Module or Struct that is tested and named well (by its role in the context if possible, rather than its data type or random name). Meta-programming will be heavily used as this is a framework, but it is important to know where it is useful and where its not. It is wise not to overuse clever meta-programming magic. If your not sure, ask, or use the force Luke (if your a Jedi). Use function pattern matching over for other types of enumeration wherever possible as this is a first-principle in Elixir systems. If your not sure how to do something, rather than do a hack, put a skeleton in place and submit a PR so a more senior engineer can provide guidance. Coding Standards No shortcuts or Rush Jobs. Quality is job #1. We are creating something of very high quality, built to stand the test of time. Strive for 0% technical debt (the best kind of debt). Frameworks are poorly suited to “agile” practices, since they require foresight and a lot of generic capabilities. Today&#39;s emphasis on “agile” development is predicated on the developer&#39;s ignorance of what is required. Frameworks cannot be developed in that manner, since they are generic and devoid of ultimate functionality. They are all about potential, not actual end-user functionality. If you don&#39;t know the best way to do something, ask a core team member, or reach out to the very helpful Elixir community. See the list of resources. Always think about what can go wrong, what will happen on invalid input, and what might fail, which will help you catch many bugs before they happen. PR Review Standards Code Reviews by core team members are required before merging and must be escalated if there is even the slightest concern of a design/logic flaw or incomplete testing. Imagine your building a rocket to mars and putting you and your family on it. Would you commmit that spaghetti code now? Every PR should have test coverage unless it is a trivial change or is approved by 2 core team members or designated reviewers. The BD — upstarter, is a stickler when it comes to architecture, design, code quality, accuracy, comprehensiveness. Be warned the project has very high standards as it must, and feel entirely free to keep him informed of his failures to follow the strict quality requirements. 😉 Don&#39;t take it personally if you receive a communication similar to this when a PR is not up to standards: Apologies, but this work cannot be accepted as it is. Perhaps there is a way it can be improved upon, but as it stands it will not be merged. Testing Standards In Progress. Property Testing? Permutation Testing? Join the conversation on The Automata Project Slack Channel Unit tests test the unit of behavior, not the unit of implementation. Changing the implementation, without changing the behavior or having to change any of your tests is the goal, although not always possible. So where possible, treat your test objects as black boxes, testing through the public API without calling private methods or tinkering with state. Special notes for Automata developers See ex_doc recommendations for documentation guidelines. DEBUGGING NOTE: anytime you see an error or warning that is in one of the mock sequence modules, it probably isn&#39;t. It is probably in one of the modules in core that get injected into them. This is the nature of meta-programming debugging. If anyone with experience debugging a heavily meta-programmed application, please chime in.
