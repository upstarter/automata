    Blackboard Architectures
      A blackboard system isn’t a decision making tool in its

      own right. It is a mechanism for coordinating the actions of several decision
      makers. The individual decision making systems can be implemented in any way:
      from a decision tree to an expert system or even to learning tools such as
      neural networks. It is this flexibility that makes blackboard architectures appealing.

    The Problem:
      We would like to be able to coordinate the decision making of several different
      techniques. Each technique may be able to make suggestions as to what to do
      next, but the final decision can only be made if they cooperate.
