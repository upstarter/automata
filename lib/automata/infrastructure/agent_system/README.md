# Agent System Extensibility Framework

This document outlines the design of the extensible agent system for Automata, which makes it easier to define, implement, and extend different types of agents.

## Design Goals

1. **Type Safety**: Ensure agent types are validated at configuration time
2. **Extensibility**: Support easy addition of new agent types without modifying core code
3. **Pluggability**: Allow users to define custom agent types through a clear interface
4. **Discoverability**: Make agent capabilities easily discoverable
5. **Maintainability**: Reduce macro usage in favor of more explicit runtime dispatch
6. **Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing agent types

## Architecture

The agent system is designed as a pluggable architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Agent Type Registry

The registry is responsible for:
- Registering agent type implementations
- Providing discoverability of available agent types
- Validating agent configurations based on type-specific schemas
- Instantiating agent implementations

### 2. Agent Type Behavior

A behavior that all agent type implementations must follow, defining the interface for:
- Initialization
- Configuration validation
- Event handling
- State management
- Lifecycle management

### 3. Agent Implementation

The runtime representation of an agent, including:
- Current state
- Event handlers
- Type-specific functionality
- Integration with the world environment

### 4. Agent Supervisor

Manages the lifecycle of agent processes with:
- Dynamic supervision based on agent type
- Fault tolerance strategies specific to agent types
- State persistence and recovery

### 5. Type-Specific Schemas

Each agent type defines its own configuration schema:
- Required and optional parameters
- Validation rules
- Default values
- Type conversion

## Type Extension Process

Adding a new agent type involves:

1. **Define a Type Schema**: Create a schema for type-specific configuration
2. **Implement Type Behavior**: Implement the `AgentType` behavior
3. **Register the Type**: Register with the agent type registry
4. **Provide Type-Specific Components**: Implement any required components specific to the type

## Implementation Approach

The implementation uses:

1. **Runtime Dispatching**: Replace macro-based injection with runtime polymorphism
2. **Behavior-Based Interfaces**: Use Elixir behaviors instead of compile-time code injection
3. **Supervision Strategies**: Define type-specific supervision strategies
4. **Schema Validation**: Use Ecto schemas for configuration validation
5. **Capability Discovery**: Provide introspection APIs for agent capabilities

## Design Patterns

The system employs several design patterns:

1. **Plugin Pattern**: Agent types as pluggable components
2. **Registry Pattern**: For type discovery and management
3. **Factory Pattern**: For creating agent implementations
4. **Strategy Pattern**: For behavior specialization
5. **Observer Pattern**: For event notification

## Migration Strategy

Existing agent types will be migrated by:

1. Creating adapter modules that implement the new behavior
2. Wrapping existing agent implementations to conform to the new interface
3. Deprecating the old macro-based approach over time

## Benefits

This design provides:

1. **Simplified Extension**: Add new agent types without modifying core code
2. **Better Testing**: More explicit interfaces make testing easier
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better validation and error reporting
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: More discoverable and self-documenting system
5. **Runtime Flexibility**: Change behavior at runtime without recompilation
